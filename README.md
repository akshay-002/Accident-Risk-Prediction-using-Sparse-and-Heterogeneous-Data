# Accident Risk Prediction and Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying regions with the highest accident-prone zones using temporal insights from the [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) on Kaggle. By developing predictive models, we aim to forecast accident likelihood, severity, and frequency. The insights derived from this analysis will contribute to proactive safety measures and enable better decision-making for traffic management.
